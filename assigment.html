            <p class="speech">Whether I should get involved in running the country at all.
                 It's a very difficult political situation. But when the students called me up and explained what
                  the situation is, finally I said, "Yes, you have given lives for this. If you can give lives, 
                  I can remove all my other considerations. I can be of your service. I'll do that."He added that,"
                  
                  People are in the mood for revolution. So this is a revolutionary situation. They were killed.
                  So they are looking for people who made their colleagues die. So people were attacking the followers of the party headed by Sheikh Hasina. 
                  When you say minority community being attacked, that minority community, particularly Hindu community, was associated with her. 
                  So you cannot distinguish whether they were attacked because they're followers of Sheikh Hasina or they were attacked because they are Hindu. 
                  But they were attacked, that's for sure. But then we took over the government and tried to bring peace. I kept telling everybody that we may 
                  have differences of opinion. That doesn't mean we have to attack each other."
